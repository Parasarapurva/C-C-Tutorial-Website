<h2>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard. The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons: <br>-: Easy to learn <br> -: Structured language <br> -: It produces efficient programs <br> -: It can handle low-level activities <br> -: It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms 
<div style="border:4px solid black"><h1>Facts about C -> </h1><hr> -:C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX. <br> -: C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s. <br>-: The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI). <br> -:The UNIX OS was totally written in C.  <br> -:Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language. <br>-: Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C. <br> -:Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C. </div>
<div style="border:4px solid black"><h1>Why Use C?</h1><hr> <br>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be: <hr> -: Operating Systems  
<br> -: Language Compilers <br>-: Assemblers<br>-:  Text Editors <br>-: Print Spoolers <br>-: Network Drivers <br>-:Modern Programs <br>-:Databases <br>-: Language Interpreters <br>-: Utilities </h2>
