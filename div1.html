<hr><div style="border:3px solid black">
C belongs to the structured, procedural paradigms of languages. It is proven, flexible and powerful and may be used for a variety of different applications. Although high-level, C and assembly language share many of the same attributes.

Some of C's most important features include:
<br>
    ->Fixed number of keywords, including a set of control primitives, such as if, for, while, switch and do while
    <br>->Multiple logical and mathematical operators, including bit manipulators
    <br>->Multiple assignments may be applied in a single statement.
    <br>->Function return values are not always required and may be ignored if unneeded.
    <br>->Typing is static. All data has type but may be implicitly converted.
    <br>->Basic form of modularity, as files may be separately compiled and linked
    <br>->Control of function and object visibility to other files via extern and static attribute
